INT. - SAM'S ROOM - DAY

Sam pulls paper and pen towards her and writes. After a few seconds she pushes paper and pen back and walks away. She quickly sits back down and pulls the paper and pen forward. Then again after a few seconds she pushes the paper away again.

FOCUS IN ON PAPER THAT SAYS:

Tennis and I

By: Sam Samson

Tennis is the only sport for me because

CUT TO:

EXT. - WALKING TO SCHOOL - MORNING

DANIEL

How's that paper going for Mr. Jones' class? I've honestly, only barely started mine.

SAM

It was tough. I struggled with it for awhile.

DANIEL

(Confused) But couldn't you pick any topic?

SAM

Yeah, I guess I just struggled with mine.

DANIEL

What'd you pick to write about?

SAM

I chose tennis.

DANIEL

Yeah? And how's your tennis going?

SAM

It’s been good, I had a couple of matches this last weekend.

DANIEL

That's great. You did well?

SAM

(NODS)

DANIEL

How's your family been doing since AJ?

SAM

I’ve been so busy. I sorta forgot about him. I do miss him though.

DANIEL

He was such a good dog. (PAUSES) This is why people should have lobsters as pets.

SAM

What?

DANIEL

Well Lobsters would live forever if it weren't for their exoskeleton crushing them. So they would make pretty awesome pets.

SAM

(rolls eyes) I'll have to consider that next time I get a pet.

EXt. - Lunch Tables - DAY

Sam is sitting and eating lunch alone. Her food sits in front of her but she can't get herself to eat it so she pulls out her phone and decides to just watch some videos. Then Daniel walks up and sits across the table with his book. They smile at one another and don't say anything. Sam goes back to her phone and Daniel starts reading.

Someone walks up and begins to talk to Daniel. He then walks away. Sam takes out her earbuds.

SAM

Who was that Daniel?

DANIEL

Oh you know, just another foster sister.

SAM

Another one? Jeez, it switches so quickly.

DANIEL

And look who she's going to sit with. (Nods to table)

SAM

Oh great, just what everybody wanted. Another one at that table.

DANIEL

Yeah and I live with her.

SAM

What do you think their trend is for this week? Wearing pink on Wednesday?

DANIEL

Yeah right. That would be too coordinated for them.

SAM

Yeah... You're probably right. What's she like?

DANIEL

I don't know, yet.

The screen goes black and then we hear the school bell ring.

INT. - SAM'S ROOM - NIGHT

Camera focus' in on the graded paper with a 65%. And then moves onto Sam eating alone.

NEXT DAY:

INT. - School Counselor's office - Day

Leo

Do you know why you were called in here today?

SAM

Because you're bored and needed someone to talk to?

Leo

Nope, would you like another guess?

SAM

(Slightly annoyed) Why am I here?

Leo

Well for starters, you lost your usual composure yesterday. You completely erupted on your teacher about your grade. What happened?

SAM

He was wrong.

Leo

About what exactly?

SAM

(Angrily) His expectations of me were off. I'm just a student no different than any other. I'm no more successful than any other student. And that's something that he needs to understand.

BLACK.

INT. - SAM'S ROOM - DAY

Sam pulls out her phone and begins texting her coach, "I won't be abl". She deletes it and begins rewriting it, "I'm not feeling well, I wont be at practice today."

A couple of seconds later she receives a response, "Okay, feel better."

INT. - SAM'S ROOM - DAY

Montage of Sam in a very comatose manner. Walking to school. Walking home from school. Looking at her tennis racket. Walking to school. Eating lunch alone. Walking Home. Finally she goes to take her racket, she begins to walk out of her room with her racket. She then walks back into the room still holding her racket and decides to put the racket in her closet. She pulls out her phone and we see that she is 

opening her messaging app to text her coach.

EXT. - Walking home - afternoon

Sam walking home alone, with earbuds in. And Daniel comes running up, trying to catch up with her.

DANIEL

Hey! What's up? We've always walked together, for like years now.

SAM

I'm sorry, I totally forgot. I just (hesitates) I just started walking.

DANIEL

(Sarcastically) I guess it's pretty easy to forget someone you've walked with everyday for years, real easy.

SAM

Hey, I'm sorry, I've already said that.

DANIEL

Yeah and I say sorry for eating the last cupcake. You just ditched me. What the hell.

SAM

I was distracted, I just started walking. What's the big deal?

DANIEL

You tell me that, when you're the one being forgotten.

SAM

It's not like you've never forgotten about me. You stood me up just a couple of weeks ago.

DANIEL

Yeah! When was that!?

SAM

When we were planning on going for a hike.

DANIEL

I wasn't allowed to. I told you that. 

(Defensive) My foster parents didn't want me to go anywhere.

SAM

Yeah and do you remember why though?

DANIEL

(Looks down)

SAM

Yeah you know why. You were failing in Mr. Jones' class. That's on you, not anyone else. This is ridiculous.

INT. - SAM'S ROOM - DAY

Once Sam gets home she takes out some tennis balls and begins to just toss them. She looks over at her closet with her tennis racket in it. She walks over to the closet and takes it out, after picking it up she realizes that she still wants nothing to do with it and puts it back in the closet, and from there decides she doesn't want the tennis balls either and puts them back in their container.

Sam sits down at her desk. She is visibly upset.

Sam walks over to a mirror and looks at herself.

SAM (V.O.)

What is wrong with me? Why am I like this? Why can't I just feel right? People tell me I'm great at this, or smart, or successful. But what does that even mean? I know I'm not. I know they're just saying it. I'm not any of these. I'm just, normal.

Ext. - Walking to school - Morning

Sam is walking to school alone. Without Daniel. We then switch perspectives to Daniel walking to school alone as well. Once he reaches school he sees Sam, he begins to wave but catches himself and instead continues to walk alone.

EXt. - Lunch Tables - DAY

Sam sees Daniel eating at their usual table and instead decides to sit another table alone.

INT. - SAM'S ROOM - DAY

Sam looks at herself in the mirror.

SAM (V.O.)

Something's gotta give. I can't keep this up.

EXt. - Lunch Tables - DAY

Daniel is sitting alone at the Lunch table. Sam walks up to the table. She goes and sits across from Daniel, without saying anything.

DANIEL

Hey Sam.

SAM

Hey.

Both SAM and Daniel

(in unison) Look

SAM

You first.

DANIEL

I wanted to apologize. You were right, (rolls eyes) as you usually are. But I screwed up I lost it.

SAM

It wasn't just you. I screwed up too. I'm really sorry that I forgot about you.

DANIEL

(Inquisitive) What's up with you?

SAM

I've been struggling with my idea of (pause) me. I feel like I'm failing. But I think I'm getting closer to figuring it out.

DANIEL

You're feeling failure? Instead of what? Success?

SAM

Yeah I guess.

DANIEL

Are you going to be okay?

Cut to: SAM'S Room

SAM (V.O.)

Yeah, I think I am.

Sam opening up her closet again and pulling out her tennis racket and grabbing her tennis balls and walking off with them.
